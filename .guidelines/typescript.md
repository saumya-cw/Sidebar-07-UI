Checklist Items:

- Annotate empty arrays: `const items: string[] = []`.
- Annotate variables initialized to `null` or `undefined`.
- Avoid `any`; use `unknown` for truly unknown types, and validate them at runtime.
- Use `as const` for literal types, compile time constants, and configuration objects/arrays to preserve literal types and enable TypeScript to catch key mismatches.
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` in generic constraints.
- Avoid type assertions (`as`); prefer type guards. (if you really need it, provide explanation)
- Never use `as any` to silence errors; fix the types (tests are exceptions).
- Document why type assertions are needed with comments.
- Follow strict compiler behaviors regardless of project TSConfig:
  - `strict: true`
  - `noImplicitAny`
  - `strictNullChecks`
  - `noImplicitReturns`
  - `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) for safe property access.
- Avoid non-null assertion (`!`) unless absolutely certain; document why when used (tests are exceptions).
- Handle `null` and `undefined` at boundaries (APIs, user input).
- Co-locate types with their implementation.
- Document complex types with JSDoc.
- Use `type` or `interface` consistently within a codebase.
- Use discriminated unions with a common property for type narrowing when it fits.
- Avoid `@ts-ignore`; use `@ts-expect-error` with a proper explanation.
- Don’t trust 3rd party data; validate at runtime and type it at boundaries.
- Keep types as simple as possible and easy to understand.
